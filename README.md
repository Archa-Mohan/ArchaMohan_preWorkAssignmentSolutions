# Pre-Work Assignment Solution

## Requirement

  *  This program allows the user to select the functionality they need to perform and exit based on the input.
  *  The different operations available are as follows:
  
      1. Checking if the input from the user is a palindrome number.
      2. Printing the pattern of stars in decreasing order based on the input number of levels.
      3. Checking whether the input number is a prime number or not.
      4. Printing Fibonacci series of size 'n' with first two numbers as 0, 1.
      0. To exit the program.
       
  ## Working
  
  * On running the program, the options for the user are displayed on the console.

  * The option displayed have numbers one to four and number zero to exit. All other options are considered as "Invalid choice".

  * The user then selects the operation they need by entering the valid option number.  
  * The user is then instructed to enter input based on the operation they are performing.
  * Once that operation is completed, the user returns to the first set of options.
  * They can select other operations or exit the program by selecting the option 0.

  * Using Switch case and do-While loop, based on the option selected by the user different functions are invoked.
